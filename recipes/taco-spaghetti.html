        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One-pot taco spaghetti is a fast-as-can-be weeknight dinner that pairs all your favorite taco fixin’s with spaghetti rather than taco shells. It's perfect for those nights when you just cannot stand the thought of a sink full of dirty dishes. Everything here comes together in one pot—from browning the beef to simmering the sauce, even boiling the spaghetti! </p>
