        <!--Description-->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I made this up one day when I couldn't find a recipe anywhere with these ingredients. So I kind of threw it together on a whim. Sugar can be adjusted for sweetness, and if the sauce gets a bit thicker than desired I suggest adding a little chicken broth as it's thickening. Serve immediately over rice.</p>
        <!--Ingredients-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package Polish sausage, or to taste, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
            <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 large green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
            <li>3/4 fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and cut into chunks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pineapple juice, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <!--Steps-->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage, onion, and green bell pepper until vegetables start to become tender, about 8 minutes; add pineapple and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pineapple is hot, about 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Beat pineapple juice and cornstarch together in a bowl using a whisk. Stir brown sugar, cider vinegar, soy sauce, and minced garlic with the pineapple juice until the sugar dissolves into the liquid; pour over the sausage mixture and cook until the sauce thickens, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
